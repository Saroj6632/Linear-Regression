This repository is comprised of  regression exercises.

### Wrangle.py
- This module has function wrangle_zillow to get zillow data from the server using credentials. 
- This function cleans the data by dropping unwanted columns and null values from entire dataframe. Null values were entirely dropped as 99.41% of data were retained.
- The columns were changed to preferred data types int64.
- outliers were handled manually in dataframe columns.
